## Introduction
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers, which is a critical metric for telecom companies. By predicting churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers, optimize strategies, and improve business outcomes.

This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify customers into "churn" and "non-churn" categories and explore the factors influencing churn.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load and preprocess the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize key trends and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and refine features for model training.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate multiple classification models.
- **Results and Interpretation**: Summarize model performance and insights.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `plotly`

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Download the dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to process the data and train the models.

```bash
jupyter notebook Customer\ Churn\ Project.ipynb
```

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including demographic, account, and service details, along with a target variable (`Churn`) indicating customer retention or churn.

## Machine Learning Models
The following models are implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations and model evaluation metrics, highlighting the most effective model for predicting customer churn.
